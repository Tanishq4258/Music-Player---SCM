About Us - Music Payer

Welcome to Music Payer! ðŸŽµ

Music Payer is a simple, student-built music player made with love using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Designed for a smooth and minimal experience, it lets users play, pause, and switch between songs from a built-in playlist â€” all without needing an internet connection.

We are a group of students passionate about web development and clean UI design. This project is a part of our learning journey and a showcase of what can be built with basic front-end technologies.

What makes Music Payer special:
- Clean and responsive design
- Easy-to-use music controls (Play, Pause, Next, Previous)
- Built-in playlist â€” no internet or APIs required
- Fully offline and privacy-friendly

We hope you enjoy using Music Payer as much as we enjoyed building it.
